This is a study of wave propagation studies in a few different scenarios. We study the axial wave propagation in:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Carbon nanorods
\item Carbon nanorods in elastic medium
\item Carbon nanorods in elastic medium with temperature dependence
\item Double nanorod system in elastic medium
\end {itemize}
